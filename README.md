# Factorial
Calculating the Factorial using Java

● Write a program that determines how many positive and negative integers have been
entered and calculates the total and average of all the entered numbers.
● Firstly ask the user to enter any number of integers. The user should enter 0 to indicate
the end of their input.
● The program should then determine the number of positive and negative integers
entered by the user, and print out the result.
● The total of all integers entered as well as the average should then be calculated and
displayed.
